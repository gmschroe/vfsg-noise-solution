# Viz For Social Good: Noise Solution

Despite being short on time this month, I couldn't resist participating in [VFSG's project with Noise Solution](https://www.vizforsocialgood.com/join-a-project/2024/7/26/noisesolution), a charity based in England that uses music mentoring programmes to transform the lives of at risk youth.

For my submission, I focused on visualising how participants' wellbeing changed from the start to the end of the programme:

## Design choices

For this project, I was inspired by the music theme to visualise the data in the shape of an old-school music player ring. Noise Solution's branding also played a large role in my design. In addition to some of their brand colours (purple, near-black, light grey, and white), I took inspiration from the photographs on their [website](https://www.noisesolution.org/), many of which have bright blues, teals, pinks, and oranges from coloured lights. 

Since I don't have a license for Noise Solution's brand font, [Roc Grotesk](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/roc-grotesk), I used a similar font with an Open Font License, [DM Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans).
